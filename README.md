# Awesome-Backup
Not ready yet

### Offered:

- The basic/important part of awesome's config. (you don't need to seperate the whole rc.lua into parts anymore)
- Clean setup with titlebar.. But without the bar
- volume & brightness lib
- More cleaner config (atleast it's better than my previous config)
