# Awesome-Backup
Not ready yet

### Offered:

- The basic/important part of awesome's config. (you don't need to seperate the whole rc.lua into parts anymore)
- Clean setup with titlebar.. But without the bar
- volume & brightness lib
- More cleaner config (atleast it's better than my previous config)

<h2>Guide</h2>

### How do you start ricing awesome?

Separating the default config can a good starting point. However, the process of it can be very annoying.

But thankfully, I've done that horrendous job.

you can get the pre-config files by clone it from here into `$HOME/.config/awesome/`

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/rklyz/Awesome-Backup.git
mkdir $HOME/.config/awesome
cp -r Awesome-Backup/awesome/* $HOME/.config/awesome/
```

Next, go to [awesome.main.apps](https://github.com/rklyz/Awesome-Backup/blob/main/awesome/main/apps.lua) and change the variables to your preferences.

### Now what?

After you've logged in into awesome window manager, you'll find an empty desktop applied with a wallpaper. (if i'm not wrong)

Now you can start 'ricing' your desktop bit by bit.

### Creating a BAR
